 # Guess My Number

Welcome to the "Guess My Number" repository! This is a mobile game app built with React Native. The game involves guessing a number chosen by the user within a specified range.

## Screens

The app consists of three screens:

1. **Number Selection Screen**: On this screen, you can enter a number between 1 and 99. Once confirmed, the game will proceed to the next screen.

2. **Game Screen**: The computer will guess your number and prompt you to provide feedback if its guess is too high or too low. You must provide accurate feedback to help the computer guess correctly. Each guess will be listed on the same screen.

3. **Game Over Screen**: After the computer guesses the correct number, this screen will display the number of turns it took. You will also have the option to start a new game.
